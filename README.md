Hi there 👋

My name is Dalton, and I am currently a third-year student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a Business Minor. Engaging in both academic and extracurricular pursuits, I am an active member of the Kappa Theta Pi Professional Technology Fraternity, the Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity, and the CU National Society of Black Engineers. Beyond my commitment to academics, I also enjoy playing basketbasll. As I advance in my studies, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world settings. Currently on the lookout for internships, I am particularly interested in opportunities within the computer science and business fields, where I can further develop my expertise and contribute to innovative projects.
